Hi, in this repository, I have worked on Customer Churn Prediction, a Machine Learning project.


Customer Churn Prediction: Customers churn out due to a lot of reasons like lack of usage, poor service, better price, etc.. In this model, I have tried to predict the churn rate pf customers.


Machine Learning concept used: Random Forest Classifier



The project dataset can be downloaded from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets


The project is entirely compiled and run in Jupyter Notebook.
